## In a nutshell
The proposed method transforms conventional grayscale mammograms into pseudo-color mammograms using multi-scale morphological sifting (MMS). The MMS can enhance lesion-like patterns within a specified size range. Two scales are used in MMS and two output images are generated. These two images are then appended to the grayscale mammogram to form a RGB pseudo-color image. The lesion-like patterns will show color contrast to the background in the new pseudo-color image as shown in the image above (blackline represent to annotation and the cyan line represent the segmentation generated by the proposed method).

The pseudo-color mammograms are then used as inputs for the Mask R-CNN. The Mask R-CNN is trained to perform simultaneous detection and segmentation of breast masses. We notice that using pseudo-color mammograms improved the detection and segmentation performance of Mask R-CNN when compared with using conventional grayscale mammograms.


## How to use the code:

The method consists of 3 steps: pre-processing, pseudo-color image generation and Mask R-CNN detection/segmentation.

### Pre-processing

This step is to normalize the raw mammograms and pad them into a square shape.

The main script is “Preprocess_mammo_mask.py”. The normalization function is in module “Preprocess_mammo.py” and the padding function is in “utility.py”.


### Pseudo-color image generation

This step is to generate two output images by applying a 2 scale morphological sifting (MS) on the mammograms. The grayscale mammogram is put in the R (red) channel, the output from the smaller scale MS is put in the G (green) channel and the output from the larger scale is put in the B (blue) channel.

* Details on multi-scale morphological sifting (MMS): [Multi-scale sifting for mammographic mass detection and segmentation](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2057-1976/aafc07)

The main script is "Pseudo_color_image_generation.m".

Function "Morphological_filter_bank.m" is to generated the magnitudes of the linear structuring elements.
Function "Morphological_sifter.m" is to perform MMS on the input image. 

### Applying Mask R-CNN

We use transfer learning with Mask R-CNN due to the size limitation of the dataset used. The pre-trained model "mask_rcnn_balloon.h5" is used.
