## In a nutshell
The proposed method transforms conventional grayscale mammograms into pseudo-color mammograms using multi-scale morphological sifting (MMS). The MMS can enhance lesion-like patterns within a specified size range. Two scales are used in MMS and two output images are generated. These two images are then appended to the grayscale mammogram to form a RGB pseudo-color image. The lesion-like patterns will show color contrast to the background in the new pseudo-color image as shown in the image above (blackline represent to annotation and the cyan line represent the segmentation generated by the proposed method).
The pseudo-color mammograms are then used as inputs for the Mask R-CNN.
